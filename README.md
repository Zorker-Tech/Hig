## Abstract

Hig is a fast, compact, project-aware archiver with secure encrypted archives, daemon-backed project watching, and a macOS desktop interface. It is designed for development workflows where repeated project snapshots matter: save a verified archive before risky edits, move a compact project state between machines, or keep a fast local recovery point.

The current stable engineering release is **v1.10.1**. See the
[v1.10.1 release notes](docs/releases/hig-v1.10.1.md). The first public release,
v1.10.0, established the HIGV2 archive format and security model while adding
an independent HIG repository history layer for byte, chunk, path, and
symbol-level recovery.

Password-protected archives use Argon2id, ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated
encryption, BLAKE3 integrity checks, and path traversal protection. The public
repository contains the format, CLI, repository, and IDE/MCP integration
implementation. Private research and paper materials are intentionally
excluded from this release.

The macOS app is signed with the locally available Apple Development identity. It is **not notarized** because Developer ID notarization credentials are not configured for this build.

The macOS, Linux, and Windows IDE packages bundle the platform-native CLI with
the constrained 67-tool Node.js MCP stdio adapter. They were built and tested
natively by GitHub Actions run `31737147626` from commit `361e6ce2`. The Linux
package targets Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64/glibc, the macOS package contains a
universal arm64/x86_64 CLI, and the Windows package targets x86_64 MSVC.

```

## Quick Start

### npm

Install the CLI and MCP server. npm selects the native package for macOS
arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64 glibc, or Windows x86_64 MSVC.

```bash
npm install --global @zorker/hig@1.10.1
hig --version
hig-mcp-server --smoke
```

### Desktop

1. Open the DMG and launch Hig.
2. Use **Runtime** to start the daemon and unlock a session if you want fast secure repeated archives.
3. Use **Projects** to initialize a directory and let Hig prepare project snapshots in the background.
4. Use **Create Archive** to pack a directory into `.hig`.
5. Use **Open Archive** to inspect and unpack a `.hig` archive.
6. Use **Cache** for dry-run GC and compaction, and **Diagnostics** for benchmark comparisons.

### CLI

Start the guided terminal interface with `hig` in an interactive terminal or
run `hig tui`. The existing subcommands remain available for scripts, CI, and
IDE/MCP integrations; a non-interactive invocation without arguments does not
start the TUI.

```bash
hig tui
hig pack <dir> -o <archive.hig> --password <password>
hig inspect <archive.hig> --password <password> --json
hig unpack <archive.hig> -d <output-dir> --password <password>
```

The TUI covers archives, project snapshots, repository history, Recovery Vault,
cache maintenance, and daemon/session controls. Passwords are entered through
masked prompts and passed to the existing CLI command over stdin. Destructive
overwrite, daemon-stop, and session-clear actions require explicit confirmation;
garbage-collection menus run report-only previews.

Project mode:

```bash
hig init <dir>
hig session unlock --password <password> --cache-dir <cache-dir>
hig pack <dir> -o <archive.hig> --use-session --cache-dir <cache-dir>
```

Benchmark:

```bash
hig bench /Volumes/Build/lobehub \
  --compare \
  --bench-suite lobehub-watch \
  --daemon required \
  --cache-dir /private/tmp/hig-v196-cache \
  --bench-dir /private/tmp/hig-v196-bench \
  --password benchmark-password \
  --json
```

## Safety Model

| Mode | Security behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Default balanced + password | Secure Argon2id KDF, random archive salt, independent block authentication, no metadata trust. |
| Session | Derives the secure key once and keeps it only in daemon memory for the configured TTL. Passwords and keys are not written to disk. |
| Project Mode | Uses a daemon-owned verified snapshot. If the watcher overflows, restarts, or loses trust, Hig falls back to full verification or fails in required mode. |
| Fastest | Explicit speed mode. It may trust metadata and reuse sealed encrypted cache, so the UI and CLI show risk warnings. |
| No encryption | Provides compression and hash verification only. It does not provide confidentiality or AEAD authentication. |

## Cache and Daemon

Hig stores compressed cache objects and metadata under the selected cache directory. The cache accelerates repeated archives and project watch workflows. It does not store plaintext passwords or derived encryption keys. Cache corruption is handled as fail-fast or cache miss; already generated `.hig` archives remain self-contained.

The daemon owns project watchers, task queues, session keys, cache state, and benchmark diagnostics. Desktop and CLI both submit work through the same daemon/task semantics for recoverable pack, unpack, rebuild, GC, and compaction operations.

## Repository History

HIG v1.10.1 provides an HIG-native content-addressed repository. It is not a
Git wire-compatible implementation. The repository records immutable commits,
FastCDC chunks, byte-range change indexes, rename-aware path history, a
compression tree, and optional Tree-sitter semantic indexes.

```bash
hig repo init <project>
hig repo snapshot <project> -m "before refactor"
hig repo diff <project> --from <commit> --to HEAD --json
hig repo restore-range <project> --path src/lib.rs --start 120 --len 1 -o byte.bin
hig repo symbols <project> --revision HEAD --json
hig repo restore-symbol <project> --revision <commit> --symbol 'Type::method' -o method.rs
hig repo verify <project> --json
```

See [docs/ide/hig-cli-tools.md](docs/ide/hig-cli-tools.md) for the complete
CLI/MCP interface and [docs/spec/hig-format-v2.md](docs/spec/hig-format-v2.md)
for the public archive format specification.

Recovery Vault setup, source-loss restore, primary-loss promotion, repair, and
retention procedures are defined in
[docs/operations/recovery-vault-runbook.md](docs/operations/recovery-vault-runbook.md).

## Benchmark Interpretation

Historical v1.9.6 and v1.9.7 benchmark reports include:

- `environment_status`: whether the selected volume passes the 256MiB copy baseline.
- `release_gate_status`: whether absolute gates passed, failed on a qualified volume, or could not be claimed because the environment was not qualified.
- `io_hotspot_summary`: the largest observed warm-path bottlenecks.
- zip, tar.gz, and tar.zst comparisons on the same corpus.

If the environment is reported as `ENVIRONMENT_NOT_QUALIFIED`, Hig still reports relative speed and size results, but it does not claim absolute `<150ms` project warm-pack performance for that run.

The v1.9.6 LobeHub RC run selected `/private/tmp` at `538.21 MiB/s`, below the `650 MiB/s` qualification threshold. It produced a `57,110,242` byte archive versus zip `67,749,385` and tar.gz `61,332,985`. Project warm median was `169.99ms`; the remaining variance was primarily output write and flush latency.
